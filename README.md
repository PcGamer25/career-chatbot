# Career Chatbot
career-chatbot is a chatbot created with the Pandorabots platform using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML). The chatbot recommends suitable careers for graduating students by asking a series of questions. Patterns are identified in the responses to those questions to identify the studentâ€™s interests. Patterns can be identified regardless of the grammatical structure of the responses. A career is recommended based on the identified interests.

Currently, the chatbot is programmed to recommend five careers for computer science graduands: software developer, web developer, computer scientist, data scientist, and business analyst.
